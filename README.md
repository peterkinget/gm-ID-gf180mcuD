# Studying Gm-ID for gf180mcuD


## Credits

This project is based on work from [Boris Murmann's Book-on-gm-ID-design](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design). All folders were removed to reduce the size of the repo and only `starter_files_open_source_tools/gf180mcuD` was kept. 

I modified the `techsweep_plots_from_mat.ipynb` into `PK_techsweep_plots_from_mat.ipynb` with an updated set of plots. Also created summary PDF files for the NMOS and PMOS transistors.

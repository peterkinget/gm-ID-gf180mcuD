# Studying Gm-ID for gf180mcuD

Goal: Reviewing the Gm-ID data for the gf180mcuD technology

## Credits

This project is based on work from [Boris Murmann's Book-on-gm-ID-design](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design). To reduce the size of the repository, all folders from the original repository were removed except `starter_files_open_source_tools/gf180mcuD`. 

I modified the `techsweep_plots_from_mat.ipynb` into `PK_techsweep_plots_from_mat.ipynb` with an updated set of plots; also created summary PDF files for the NMOS and PMOS transistors.
